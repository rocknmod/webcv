This project is to create a new Website to host my CV using automation accross AWS and Azure for a multi-cloud deployment.

#Introduction
- What services should the public cloud deployment offer to the customers?
- How will the users consume those services? Will they use Internet access or will you have to provide a more dedicated connectivity solution?
- Identify the data needed by the solution you're deploying. What data is shared with other applications? Where will the data reside?
- What are the security requirements of your application?
- What are the high availability requirements?
- Do you have to provide connectivity to your on-premises data center? If so, how will you implement it?
- Do you have to implement connectivity to other (customer) sites? If so, how will you implement it?
